# ZENITH STUDIO

Zenith Studio is an online coding platform developed as a solution for Tally
CodeBrewers as a part of the hackathon with the theme "The Commander of Full
Stack".

## Problem Statement

- Platform should support at least one compiled language.
- User management is not required (login, sign-up, profile, etc.).

##### Coding Playground

- A place where users can play with code.
- Users can code in a code editor and execute it with custom inputs.
- Users can see errors, output and metrics like execution time & memory usage.

##### Coding Arena

- A place where users can practice their coding skills by solving various
  problems available on the platform.
- A user may upload their own coding problem along with its description,
  constraints and test cases.

##### Coding Battleground

- A place where users can compete in ongoing contests hosted on the platform to
  showcase their skills.
- Users can see real-time leaderboards.
- Any user can conduct their own contest.
